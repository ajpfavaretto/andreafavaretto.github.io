# Scientific Portfolio – siRNA, Delivery and Retinal Biology

This repository collects my scientific work and learning path in three main areas:

1. **siRNA and gene regulation**
2. **Delivery technologies for RNA-based therapies**
3. **Retinal physiology and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)**

The goal is to build a coherent body of work that connects molecular technologies, bioengineering and clinical physiology.

## Sections

- `siRNA/` – Fundamentals of siRNA, mechanism of action, inflammatory targets, risks and preclinical evidence.
- `Retina_RPE/` – Physiology of the retinal pigment epithelium, early degeneration and inflammatory pathways.
- `Delivery_Technologies/` – Barriers, nanoparticle design and delivery challenges for ocular tissues.
- `Integrative_Projects/` – Projects that integrate all three areas (for example: siRNA modulation of inflammatory pathways in RPE).

This is a work in progress and will be updated as I study, analyse and write.
