# Integrative Projects

Here I collect projects and narrative reviews that connect:

- siRNA mechanisms
- Delivery technologies
- Retinal physiology and early degeneration

The aim is to show how these domains can be integrated into coherent scientific concepts and potential therapeutic strategies.

Current and planned documents include:
- `siRNA_RPE_inflammation.md` – siRNA modulation of inflammatory pathways in RPE (early retinal degeneration)
- `nutraceutical_synergy.md` – Possible synergy between advanced nutraceutical strategies and siRNA-based approaches
