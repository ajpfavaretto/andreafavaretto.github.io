# **siRNA and modulation of inflammatory pathways in the RPE during early retinal degeneration**

*Narrative Review*

---

## **Abstract**

Early retinal degeneration, particularly in the initial stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic activation of inflammatory pathways in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In recent years, siRNA technology has emerged as a potential tool to selectively modulate key genes involved in chronic inflammation and cellular dysfunction. This review critically examines the biological rationale, molecular targets, preclinical evidence, delivery challenges and future perspectives for siRNA-based approaches aimed at protecting the RPE. It highlights the systemic limitations slowing clinical translation and outlines how biomedical engineering could contribute to overcoming them.

## **1. Background**

RPE health is essential for photoreceptor function and the long-term survival of rods and cones. In early retinal degeneration, the RPE undergoes functional alterations driven by:

* accumulation of ROS and lipofuscin
* mitochondrial impairment
* release of inflammatory mediators
* activation of NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling
* increased permeability and impaired phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments

Persistent inflammatory activity contributes to the transition from subclinical alteration to structural degeneration.
siRNA technology fits within this context as a tool capable of targeting specific inflammatory mediators and dampening pathologic cascades with high precision.

## **2. Biological rationale for siRNA use in the RPE**

### **2.1 RNA interference: molecular precision**

siRNA mediates selective degradation of complementary mRNA through incorporation into the RISC complex.
In a multifactorial disorder such as retinal degeneration, this precision is a major advantage, allowing modulation of individual inflammatory nodes without disrupting global cellular functions.

### **2.2 RPE as a biologically accessible target**

The RPE exhibits features favorable for RNA interference:

* robust phagocytic activity that can enhance particle uptake
* natural ability to internalize nanoparticles
* expression of receptors involved in endocytosis
* relatively predictable response to genetic modulation

### **2.3 Strategic inflammatory pathways**

The most relevant siRNA targets include:

* **TNF-α**
* **IL-1β**
* **NLRP3 inflammasome components**
* **VEGF** (in forms with early vascular involvement)
* **C3 and complement pathway mediators**

Modulating these nodes means intervening early in the pathogenic cascade before irreversible structural damage occurs.

## **3. Available preclinical evidence**

### **3.1 Cellular models**

In vitro studies using ARPE-19 and primary RPE cells show:

* anti-TNF-α siRNA decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine expression
* C3-targeting siRNA reduces complement activation
* NLRP3-targeting siRNA lowers inflammatory stress and mitochondrial damage

These findings are consistent, though strongly dependent on transfection efficiency.

### **3.2 Animal models**

In vivo evidence remains limited.
Studies in mice and rabbits have shown:

* reduced edema and inflammatory markers
* partial improvement of RPE structure
* enhanced cell survival in oxidative or toxic injury models

However, no available animal model fully reproduces early human retinal degeneration.

### **3.3 siRNA interactions with the retinal environment**

The retina poses several challenges:

* inner limiting membrane
* blood-retinal barrier
* extracellular nucleases

Unprotected siRNA degrades rapidly, making delivery engineering essential.

## **4. Delivery challenges: the true bottleneck**

### **4.1 Protection from degradation**

Free siRNA is rapidly degraded by RNases present in ocular and systemic fluids.

### **4.2 Ocular tissue penetration**

* Topical administration is ineffective.
* Intravitreal injection offers limited access to the RPE.
* Subretinal injection is effective but highly invasive.

### **4.3 Need for intelligent carriers**

Current systems include:

* ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
* polymeric nanoparticles
* cell-penetrating peptides
* lipophilic conjugates
* hybrid nutraceutical-nanocarriers

None has yet demonstrated stable, safe and predictable clinical translation for targeting the RPE.

## **5. Critical discussion**

### **5.1 Strong biological rationale, minimal clinical evidence**

siRNA for RPE targeting is conceptually strong, but clinical-grade studies are scarce.
The technology is biologically ready, but the delivery is not.

### **5.2 RPE complexity is underestimated**

Most studies attempt to silence single mediators (TNF-α, C3, NLRP3).
However, the RPE operates through interconnected networks.
Silencing one node may trigger compensatory responses.

### **5.3 Delivery, not siRNA, is the limiting factor**

This is the key point:
the molecular technology is advanced, but **the physical delivery technology is lagging behind**.

### **5.4 Lack of meaningful biomarkers**

Current studies rely on generic endpoints (e.g., retinal thickness, inflammatory markers).
There is a need for:

* molecular imaging
* real-time markers of RPE inflammation
* quantifiable indicators of siRNA uptake

Without biomarkers, translation is blocked.

---

## **6. Current limitations**

* instability of siRNA in vivo
* unpredictable biodistribution in ocular tissues
* invasive administration routes
* risk of off-targets and TLR activation
* inadequate molecular dosimetry
* incomplete knowledge of how siRNA behaves in oxidative microenvironments

---

## **7. Future perspectives**

### **7.1 Toward non-invasive delivery**

Future work is moving toward:

* ultra-stable ocular nanoparticles
* eye-specific LNPs
* magnetic or photo-activated delivery systems

### **7.2 Multi-target network approaches**

Future strategies will likely involve silencing combinations of genes:
TNF-α + NLRP3 + C3, for example, to modulate entire inflammatory micro-networks.

### **7.3 Integration with engineered nutraceutical strategies**

Synergistic approaches could improve cellular conditions for siRNA activity:

* high-bioavailability antioxidants
* mitochondrial modulators
* compounds reducing oxidative stress in the RPE

This integrated strategy may increase therapeutic feasibility.

### **7.4 Personalization and biomarkers**

Development of molecular imaging tools for:

* assessing siRNA uptake
* monitoring early inflammatory signals
* predicting patient-specific responses

---

## **8. Conclusion**

siRNA-mediated modulation of inflammatory pathways in the RPE is one of the most promising frontiers for slowing early retinal degeneration.
The biological rationale is robust, yet the gap between bench and bedside remains wide.
Progress depends not on perfecting siRNA sequences, but on advancing delivery systems that are stable, predictable and non-invasive.
A hybrid future is likely: molecular technologies complemented by nutraceutical engineering, predictive models and advanced materials science.
