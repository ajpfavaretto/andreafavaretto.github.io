# Delivery Technologies for RNA-based Therapies

This section covers:

- Ocular barriers and challenges for drug delivery
- Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and ionizable lipids
- Polymeric nanoparticles and hybrid systems
- Local vs systemic delivery to the eye
- Future perspectives in non-invasive delivery to the RPE

The focus is on translating molecular ideas (like siRNA) into physically feasible therapeutic strategies.
