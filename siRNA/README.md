# siRNA – Fundamentals and Inflammatory Targets

This section collects notes and narrative reviews on:

- The basic mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi)
- siRNA design principles
- RISC loading and mRNA degradation
- Inflammatory targets relevant for retinal degeneration (TNF-α, C3, NLRP3, etc.)
- Safety, off-target effects and innate immune activation

These documents are not just summaries: they are meant to reflect my understanding and critical interpretation of the literature as I progress in this field.
